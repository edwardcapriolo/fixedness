The name
=========
Functional fixedness is a cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in Gestalt Psychology, a movement in psychology that emphasizes holistic processing. Karl Duncker defined functional fixedness as being a "mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem." (Duncker, 1945) This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they can not move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight. This inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails, is functional fixedness. The person couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.
